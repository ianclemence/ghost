# Self-Improving Compound

An agent memory and learning system that replaces naive file-based memory with a structured pipeline: real-time capture, observable Candidate → Learning → Promotion queues, automated cron-based audit, and continuous promotion of lessons into skills and agent instructions.

The system runs as four layers:
- **Layer 0 — Observable memory pipeline**: ambiguous or high-value experience moves through `Candidate → Learning → Promotion → Done` using `scripts/memory-pipeline.py`, with `learning/pipeline/candidates.jsonl`, `promotion-queue.json`, `status.json`, and `dashboard.md` making backlog and coverage visible.
- **Layer 1 — Real-time capture**: AGENTS.md final-before-reply gate logs corrections, errors, and workarounds to SQLite as they happen.
- **Layer 2 — Cron audit**: Isolated background jobs scan recent conversation context. Prefer a deterministic local transcript/context collector; use `session_search` only when it is verified in the runtime. The jobs detect missed lessons and maintain lifecycle (HOT → WARM → COLD).
- **Layer 3 — Daily factual memory**: a nightly `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` digest records decisions, paths, risks, links, and follow-ups; only reusable lessons are extracted into SQLite.
- **Layer 4 — Promotion + stewardship**: proven rules flow from `learning/` SQLite → `skills/` SKILL.md → the 7 root Markdown control-plane files (`AGENTS.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `SOUL.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `USER.md`). The full 3+7 system co-evolves.

## Installation and activation — installing the skill is only step 1

A plain install only copies the skill files. It does **not** automatically wire the agent into a self-improving operating loop.

Use this maturity ladder:

| Level | What is configured | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1/5 | Skill installed | Files are present; almost no behavior changes yet. |
| 2/5 | `learning/` initialized and CLI verified | Manual logging/search works. |
| 3/5 | Capture gate added to agent instructions | The agent remembers to log lessons before final replies. |
| 4/5 | Cron jobs installed and delivery configured | Missed lessons, failures, daily memory, and steward checks run automatically. |
| 5/5 | Hooks/env/collector verified | Activation reminders, error capture, path resolution, and daily factual memory are reliable. |

### Phase 0 — Identify roots

You must distinguish two roots:

```bash
# Workspace root: where memory/, learning/, AGENTS.md, etc. live
export GHOST_WORKSPACE="/path/to/workspace"

# Optional shared lesson store for multiple workspace roots
# export SELF_IMPROVING_LEARNING_ROOT="$HOME/.ghost/shared-learning"

# Skill root: where this skill was installed
export SELF_IMPROVING_SKILL_DIR="$GHOST_WORKSPACE/skills/self-improving-compound"
export SELF_IMPROVING_LEARNINGS_CLI="$SELF_IMPROVING_SKILL_DIR/scripts/learnings.py"
```

For Ghost's default workspace this is usually:

```bash
export GHOST_WORKSPACE="${GHOST_WORKSPACE_DIR:-$HOME/.ghost/workspace}"
export SELF_IMPROVING_SKILL_DIR="$GHOST_WORKSPACE/skills/self-improving-compound"
export SELF_IMPROVING_LEARNINGS_CLI="$SELF_IMPROVING_SKILL_DIR/scripts/learnings.py"
```

Do not write durable learnings into the skill directory. By default `learning/` belongs under the workspace root; use `SELF_IMPROVING_LEARNING_ROOT` or `--learning-root` only when several workspaces should share one lesson store.

### Phase 1 — Install files

```bash
# The skill ships with Ghost; confirm it is present:
ls "$SELF_IMPROVING_SKILL_DIR/SKILL.md"
cd "$SELF_IMPROVING_SKILL_DIR"
chmod +x scripts/*.py scripts/*.sh hooks/*.sh 2>/dev/null || true
```

If the skill is copied manually, set `SELF_IMPROVING_SKILL_DIR` to the copied directory.

The bundled shell helpers require bash. On POSIX `sh`-only hosts, use the Python CLI directly and skip the `.sh` helpers.

### Phase 2 — Initialize and verify the learning store

```bash
python3 "$SELF_IMPROVING_LEARNINGS_CLI" --root "$GHOST_WORKSPACE" init
python3 "$SELF_IMPROVING_LEARNINGS_CLI" --root "$GHOST_WORKSPACE" status
python3 "$SELF_IMPROVING_LEARNINGS_CLI" --root "$GHOST_WORKSPACE" search "install smoke test" --limit 3
```

Expected result:

- `learning/memory_tree/chunks.db` exists.
- `status` exits successfully.
- `search` works even when there are no results.

### Phase 3 — Add the capture gate to agent instructions

Add a compact rule to the agent's durable instruction file, usually `AGENTS.md`:

```markdown
## Self-improvement capture gate

Before the final reply after any non-trivial task, check whether the work involved a user correction, non-obvious failure, tool/API quirk, workaround, format mismatch, missing capability, or reusable convention.

If yes:
1. Search existing learnings first:
   `python3 $SELF_IMPROVING_LEARNINGS_CLI --root $GHOST_WORKSPACE search "<keywords>" --limit 5`
2. If no suitable entry exists, log the durable lesson with `log-correction`, `log-error`, `log-learning`, or `log-feature`.
3. Keep entries compact, prevention-oriented, and secret-free.
```

Without this phase the skill remains mostly passive; the agent will not consistently capture lessons in real time.

### Phase 4 — Install the cron pipeline

Cron installation is not automatic. The templates live in `scripts/setup-cron.json`; agent-facing instructions live in `scripts/setup-cron-agent.md`.

Recommended Ghost flow:

1. Ask the agent: "Install the self-improving compound cron jobs using `scripts/setup-cron.json`. Check existing jobs first and update instead of duplicating."
2. Configure delivery for your channel, e.g. Telegram or Feishu.
3. Verify with `cron list`.

The pipeline normally includes:

| Job | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Self-Improving Light Check | Frequent lightweight scan for missed corrections, errors, and blockers. |
| Learning Audit Heavy | System/cron failure audit, `learning-audit.py --log`, lifecycle maintenance. |
| Daily Memory Digest | Writes `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` factual continuity notes and extracts reusable lessons. |
| Daily Workspace Steward | Exports `learning/`, checks `skills/`, and inspects the 7 root Markdown control-plane files. |

Important cron requirements:

- Set `schedule.tz` to the user's actual timezone.
- Set or infer `delivery.channel` and `delivery.to`; otherwise reports may not reach the user.
- Use `cron update` for existing jobs; do not create duplicates.
- Isolated cron sessions do not inherit main chat context. Jobs that need conversation context should prefer an explicit collector that exports recent visible conversation to a file. Use `sessions_list` / `session_search` only after verifying those tools can access the target session from isolated cron.

### Phase 5 — Configure optional hooks

Hooks are optional but improve activation. They are runtime-specific.

Dry-run the bundled hooks first:

```bash
"$SELF_IMPROVING_SKILL_DIR/hooks/activator.sh" "install smoke test" || true
"$SELF_IMPROVING_SKILL_DIR/hooks/error-detector.sh" "install" "smoke test" || true
```

If your client supports command hooks, wire:

- `hooks/activator.sh` as a pre-prompt / prompt-start reminder.
- `hooks/error-detector.sh` as a post-error / failed-command reminder.

If your runtime has no hook system, skip this phase and rely on the capture gate plus cron. Do not invent config keys; use your runtime's documented hook mechanism.

### Phase 6 — Configure the observable memory pipeline

The bundled `scripts/memory-pipeline.py` adds an explicit queue and dashboard around cron/context scanning. It is optional for tiny installs but recommended for reliable systems.

```bash
export SELF_IMPROVING_MEMORY_PIPELINE="$SELF_IMPROVING_SKILL_DIR/scripts/memory-pipeline.py"
# Optional if the Ghost session key is ambiguous:
# export SELF_IMPROVING_MAIN_SESSION_KEY="agent:main:<channel>:direct:<id>"
python3 "$SELF_IMPROVING_MEMORY_PIPELINE" --base "$GHOST_WORKSPACE/learning/pipeline" dashboard
```

State files:

- `learning/pipeline/candidates.jsonl` — suspected lessons awaiting dedupe/logging.
- `learning/pipeline/promotion-queue.json` — logged lessons awaiting skill/root-file promotion.
- `learning/pipeline/cursor.json` — last processed transcript line for incremental cron scans.
- `learning/pipeline/dashboard.md` and `learning/dashboard.md` — human-readable health view.

Cron Light Check should prefer this flow: `collect-incremental → add/mark candidates → log learnings → add/mark promotions → dashboard → commit-cursor`. Commit the cursor only after successful processing.

### Phase 7 — Configure optional context collectors

For reliable cron audits, prefer deterministic collectors over implicit chat context. A collector is a local command that reads the runtime's session/transcript store and writes recent visible user/assistant text to a Markdown or JSON file. It should skip tool outputs, hidden thinking, secrets, and raw long transcripts.

Light Check can use a local recent-conversation collector:

```bash
export SELF_IMPROVING_LIGHT_CONTEXT_COLLECTOR="python3 /path/to/recent-context-collector.py --limit 60"
```

Collector contract:

- Exit `0` only when context was exported successfully.
- Print either the output context path or a compact JSON summary containing the path/status.
- Write a readable Markdown/JSON context file with recent user/assistant visible text.
- Exit non-zero if the transcript/session cannot be found; the cron job should report `BLOCKED: collector_unavailable` instead of claiming success.

`Daily Memory Digest` can also use a local collector if your runtime has one:

```bash
export SELF_IMPROVING_DAILY_COLLECTOR="python3 /path/to/collector.py"
bash "$SELF_IMPROVING_SKILL_DIR/scripts/daily-memory.sh" --root "$GHOST_WORKSPACE"
```

If no collector is configured, the helper prints the target note contract and the agent must gather context with available runtime tools.

### Phase 8 — End-to-end smoke test

Run this checklist after installation:

```bash
python3 "$SELF_IMPROVING_LEARNINGS_CLI" --root "$GHOST_WORKSPACE" log-learning \
  --summary "Self-improving install smoke test" \
  --details "Temporary entry to verify logging path; mark resolved or delete if desired." \
  --pattern "install:smoke-test" \
  --area "domain:setup"

python3 "$SELF_IMPROVING_LEARNINGS_CLI" --root "$GHOST_WORKSPACE" search "install smoke test" --limit 5
bash "$SELF_IMPROVING_SKILL_DIR/scripts/learning-export.sh"
bash "$SELF_IMPROVING_SKILL_DIR/scripts/daily-memory.sh" --root "$GHOST_WORKSPACE" --date "$(TZ=Asia/Shanghai date +%F)"
```

Then verify:

- `learning/memory-export.md` exists.
- `learning/status.json` exists.
- `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` target is clear if daily memory is enabled.
- `cron list` shows the expected enabled jobs with `nextRunAtMs`.
- Delivery target is configured for cron job summaries.

### Common install failures

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Skill installed but nothing changes | Capture gate and cron not configured | Complete phases 3-4. |
| Cron runs but finds no conversation context | Isolated session has no main history or `session_search` is restricted | Configure `SELF_IMPROVING_LIGHT_CONTEXT_COLLECTOR`; use `session_search` only as a verified fallback. |
| Learnings appear under the skill directory | Wrong `--root` | Set `GHOST_WORKSPACE`; always pass `--root`. |
| Cron summaries disappear | `delivery` missing channel/recipient | Set `delivery.channel` + `delivery.to`. |
| Daily memory is generic or empty | No collector/context source | Configure `SELF_IMPROVING_DAILY_COLLECTOR` or improve the cron prompt. |
| Duplicate cron jobs | Setup re-run without idempotency check | `cron list` first; update by job name. |

## 3+7 co-evolution model

The **3** state directories are:

- `memory/` — factual daily continuity.
- `learning/` — SQLite-backed execution lessons.
- `skills/` — hardened reusable procedures.

The **7** root Markdown control-plane files are:

- `AGENTS.md` — workspace contract, routing, execution policy, safety boundaries.
- `HEARTBEAT.md` — lightweight check-in surface; often intentionally empty when cron owns timing.
- `IDENTITY.md` — compatibility pointer or short identity bridge.
- `MEMORY.md` — pinned long-term hot context.
- `SOUL.md` — agent identity/persona.
- `TOOLS.md` — concrete local environment/tool facts.
- `USER.md` — durable user profile and collaboration preferences.

The steward loop should keep these layers aligned with small, safe edits only. It must not rewrite persona, weaken safety/privacy rules, or promote volatile daily facts into root-level bloat.

## Core idea

Use this system for **durable improvement**, not for every bump in the road.

### Mandatory capture gate

Before a final reply, run this quick check:

- Did the task include a non-obvious failure, API/tool quirk, or format mismatch?
- Did a workaround or environment-specific convention make the task succeed?
- Did the user correct a fact, preference, workflow, or expectation?
- Would repeating this lesson save time or prevent damage later?

If yes, **search existing learnings first, then log the lesson before replying**. Do not rely on a “mental note.”

A good entry usually has at least one of these properties:
- It corrected a wrong assumption.
- It revealed a project-specific convention.
- It required real debugging or investigation.
- It is likely to recur.
- It should change future workflow, memory, or tooling.

Do **not** log routine noise such as obvious typos, expected validation failures, or errors that were solved immediately with no transferable lesson.

### Capture gate output routing

Not all lessons go to the same place. Route based on type:

| Lesson type | Destination | Example |
|---|---|---|
| User facts, preferences, system state | `MEMORY.md` / `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | "Rockway prefers newspaper theme" |
| Execution mistakes, tool gotchas, workarounds | `learning/` SQLite | "Python shadowing broke promote" |
| Stable rules, workflows, anti-patterns discovered | owning `skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` | "cron isolation means no session context" |
| Behavioral constraints | `AGENTS.md` | "Don't commit workspace root" |
| Environment-specific tool knowledge | `TOOLS.md` | "Tailscale node name" |

The full 3+7 system co-evolves: fixing one layer while leaving another stale is half-done work. When a lesson reveals a skill is stale, upgrade it immediately and bump its version.

## Hybrid architecture

This skill merges three design lineages into one portable package:

| Lineage | Role | What We Kept |
|---|---|---|
| **actual-self-improvement** | Execution core | Python CLI (`scripts/learnings.py`), structured logging, JSON evals, search-before-log dedupe |
| **OpenHuman memory-tree** | Storage core | SQLite chunks, FTS search, entity index, scores, hotness, async jobs, deterministic tree buffers, lifecycle status, idempotent ingest |
| **self-improving-compound** | Memory architecture | HOT/WARM/COLD lifecycle, workspace-scoped `learning/`, lightweight bootstrap markdown |
| **self-improving-agent-local** | Promotion & hooks | Quantified promotion thresholds, Ghost hook guidance, pattern-key recurrence rules |

### Directory layout under `learning/`

```
learning/
├── memory_tree/chunks.db  # SQLite source of truth for durable learnings
├── index.md               # SQLite-generated snapshot (entries, lifecycle, pattern keys)
├── promotion-queue.json   # bounded maintain queue for proven promotion candidates
├── projects/              # WARM tier (project-specific)
├── domains/               # WARM tier (domain-specific)
└── archive/               # COLD tier (inactive)
```

## Important path model

There are **two different roots** in this skill:

1. **Skill root** — where bundled resources live:
   - `scripts/...`
   - `references/...`
   - `hooks/...`

2. **Workspace root** — where the project or active workspace lives:
   - `learning/memory_tree/chunks.db`
   - `learning/index.md` (SQLite-generated snapshot)
   - `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` factual daily notes, when enabled
   - `learning/projects/`
   - `learning/domains/`
   - `learning/archive/`
   - root agent files such as `AGENTS.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `USER.md`, `SOUL.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`, `IDENTITY.md`

When `SELF_IMPROVING_LEARNING_ROOT` or `--learning-root` is set, the `learning/*` files above live in that shared learning root instead. Promotions still target the active **workspace root**, so a shared store can feed multiple projects without writing AGENTS/TOOLS files into the wrong workspace.

Never write learnings into the installed skill directory. Always target the **workspace root** for project memory and the optional **learning root** for shared lesson storage.


## Activation hardening mechanisms

When this skill is installed in a persistent agent runtime, self-improvement must be enforced by the system rather than left to memory. The recommended architecture uses three enforcement loops:

- **Capture gate**: an agent instruction requiring `search + log` before every final reply after a non-trivial task. This catches lessons in real-time during active work.
- **Cron enforcement**: isolated background jobs that audit recent session history, scan for system failures, maintain lifecycle, and export SQLite for review. Cron runs in *isolated sessions* that do not consume the main conversation context.
- **Daily stewardship**: a factual daily digest plus a post-digest workspace steward keep `memory/`, `learning/`, `skills/`, and the 7 root Markdown control-plane files aligned without broad rewrites.

### Architecture decisions (why cron, not heartbeat)

- **Cron is isolated.** `sessionTarget: "isolated"` creates a fresh ephemeral session that does not pollute the main agent's context window or bust prompt-cache warmth.
- **Cron context must be explicit.** An isolated cron job does not automatically see the main chat. Prefer a deterministic collector that reads the runtime's local session/transcript store and exports recent user/assistant visible text to a file. `sessions_list` / `session_search` can be used only when you have verified they work from isolated cron; otherwise they create false confidence.
- **Heartbeat runs in the main session by default.** Its role should be limited to lightweight check-ins and urgent reminders. Do not embed audit execution commands in `HEARTBEAT.md`; keep that file minimal so heartbeat returns `HEARTBEAT_OK` quickly unless an urgent decision is needed.

### Recommended cron schedule

```text
Cron                                     Schedule (Asia/Shanghai)
──────────────────────────────────────   ──────────────────────
Self-Improving Light Check               0 8-22/2 * * *    (every 2h during waking hours)
Learning Audit (Heavy)                   0 9,22 * * *      (2x/day)
Daily Memory Digest                      50 23 * * *       (nightly factual memory)
Daily Workspace Steward                  20 0 * * *        (post-digest maintenance)
```

#### Light Check (every 2h, 08:00-22:00)

A quick in-between scan that reads recent conversation context and checks whether any user correction, non-obvious error, workaround, or tool/API quirk has been missed by the SQLite learning store. Preferred path: run `SELF_IMPROVING_LIGHT_CONTEXT_COLLECTOR`, read its exported Markdown/JSON, then dedupe with `learnings.py search`. Fallback path: use `sessions_list` / `session_search` only if verified from isolated cron. Tools: `exec`, `read`; optionally `sessions_list`, `session_search` for the fallback. Timeout: 120-180s.

#### Heavy Audit (09:00, 22:00)

Full audit: system-failure check, cron-failure scan, `learning-audit.py --log`, and `learnings.py maintain --apply` for lifecycle promotion/demotion. Tools: `exec`, `read`, `cron`. Timeout: 240s.

#### Daily Memory Digest (23:50)

Run `scripts/daily-memory.sh`, gather or read the daily context, write `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, then run the capture gate on the final note. Facts stay in `memory/`; compact reusable lessons go to SQLite. See `references/daily-memory-digest.md`. Timeout: 300s.

#### Daily Workspace Steward (00:20)

Run `scripts/learning-export.sh`, inspect `learning/`, `skills/*/SKILL.md`, and root agent markdown files for small safe consistency updates. It may fix verified stale facts or clear contradictions, but must not rewrite persona, weaken safety/privacy rules, delete files, or change cron jobs. Timeout: 300s.

### Cron installation (one-time setup)

**The cron jobs described above are NOT created automatically when you install this skill.** You must run the setup once to create them in your Ghost instance.

The production-grade cron job definitions are in `scripts/setup-cron.json`. The agent-facing setup guide is `scripts/setup-cron-agent.md`.

Quick setup (run from your Ghost main session):

1. **Confirm**: "I want to install the self-improving compound cron jobs. Use `scripts/setup-cron.json` as reference."

2. Your agent will:
   - Read the JSON definitions
   - Resolve placeholder paths (skill root, workspace root)
   - Ask or infer your delivery channel (Telegram / Feishu / etc.)
   - Call `cron add` / `cron update` for each job, avoiding duplicates

3. **Verify**: `cron list` should show enabled jobs with `nextRunAtMs` set.

If you already have these jobs running, this step is a no-op.

### AGENTS.md capture gate

Add the following rule to agent instructions (e.g. AGENTS.md):

> Before every final reply after a non-trivial task: if the task involved a user correction, non-obvious failure, API/tool quirk, workaround, format mismatch, missing capability, or reusable convention, search existing SQLite learning first with `scripts/learnings.py --root <workspace> search "<keywords>" --limit 5`. If no suitable entry exists, log the durable lesson before replying. Never rely on a mental note; `learning/memory_tree/chunks.db` is the execution-learning source of truth.

### System failure routing

Route watchdog, doctor, healthcheck, and cron failure signals into `log-error` with stable pattern keys and dedupe:

- Pattern keys: `cron:<job-name>`, `doctor:<check-name>`, `watchdog:<component>`, `system:ghost-audit-failure`
- Use `scripts/log-system-failures.sh` as an Ghost CLI audit wrapper where available.
- Always search existing entries first to prevent repeated failures from flooding SQLite.

### Guardrails

- Keep entries compact and prevention-oriented.
- Never log secrets; the CLI redacts tokens, passwords, and API keys automatically.
- Do not paste full audit exports into chat unless explicitly asked.
- Treat audit candidates as review prompts rather than automatic truth.
- Cron runs should reply with one-line summaries or `HEARTBEAT_OK`; do not echo full command output.

## Quick decision table

| Situation | What to do |
|---|---|
| User corrects you or updates a fact | Log a **correction** |
| Non-obvious command / API / tool failure | Log an **error** |
| User asks for a missing capability | Log a **feature request** |
| You discover a reusable workaround or convention | Log a **learning** |
| A pattern keeps recurring | Search related entries, link with `See Also`, and consider promotion |
| A lesson is broadly applicable or repeated | Promote it into project memory |
| A resolved, general pattern could help other projects | Extract a new skill |

## Standard workflow

### 0) Optional nightly factual memory

If the workspace uses daily factual notes, run or schedule:

```bash
bash scripts/daily-memory.sh --root /absolute/path/to/workspace
```

Then write `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` from the gathered context and run the capture gate on that note. Use `references/daily-memory-digest.md` for the quality bar. Do not copy the diary into SQLite; extract only reusable prevention rules.

### 1) Find the workspace root first

Before reading or writing `learning/`, determine `WORKSPACE_ROOT`.

Good defaults:
- the repository root for the current codebase
- the Ghost workspace root (`GHOST_WORKSPACE` env var)
- the directory containing the files being edited

If unsure, prefer the directory containing `.git`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or the user's active project files.

### 2) Initialise `learning/` if needed

Use the helper instead of creating files manually:

```bash
python3 scripts/learnings.py --root /absolute/path/to/workspace init
```

This creates:
- `learning/memory_tree/chunks.db` (SQLite database)
- `learning/projects/`
- `learning/domains/`
- `learning/archive/`

The `learning/index.md` snapshot is generated on first write (log, promote, etc.).

### 3) Review existing learnings before risky or familiar work

Review first when:
- you are returning to an area with prior failures
- the task touches infra, CI, deployment, auth, data migration, or generated code
- the user explicitly says "remember this", "we hit this before", or similar

Use the helper:

```bash
python3 scripts/learnings.py --root /absolute/path/to/workspace status
python3 scripts/learnings.py --root /absolute/path/to/workspace search "pnpm" --limit 5
python3 scripts/learnings.py --root /absolute/path/to/workspace search "pnpm" --touch

# --root can also be placed after the subcommand
python3 scripts/learnings.py status --root /absolute/path/to/workspace --format json
```

Plain `search` is read-only. Use `--touch` only when the result was actually reused and should increment recurrence metadata.

### 4) Search before logging to avoid duplicates

Always search for related entries before creating a new one.

```bash
python3 scripts/learnings.py --root /absolute/path/to/workspace search "keyword or pattern" --limit 10
```

If a similar entry already exists:
- prefer linking with `See Also`
- reuse or add a stable `Pattern-Key` for recurring issues
- bump priority only when recurrence justifies it
- prefer updating the existing pattern story over spraying near-duplicate entries

### 5) Log the right kind of entry

#### Correction
Use for user corrections and updated facts. Stored in SQLite with a human ID such as `COR-YYYYMMDD-001`.

```bash
python3 scripts/learnings.py --root /absolute/path/to/workspace log-correction \
  --summary "Used wrong format for Telegram" \
  --correct "Use lists, not tables" \
  --pattern chat:telegram-format
```

#### Learning
Use for corrections, knowledge gaps, best practices, and durable conventions. Stored in SQLite with a human ID such as `LRN-YYYYMMDD-001`.

```bash
python3 scripts/learnings.py --root /absolute/path/to/workspace log-learning \
  --summary "Project uses pnpm workspaces, not npm" \
  --details "Attempted npm install. Lockfile and workspace config showed pnpm." \
  --pattern pkg:pnpm-workspace
```

#### Error
Use for non-obvious failures, exceptions, or tool/API issues worth remembering. Stored in SQLite with a human ID such as `ERR-YYYYMMDD-001`.

```bash
python3 scripts/learnings.py --root /absolute/path/to/workspace log-error \
  --summary "Docker build failed on Apple Silicon due to platform mismatch" \
  --details "docker build -t myapp . on Apple Silicon" \
  --pattern docker:platform
```

#### Feature request
Use when the user wants a missing capability or a recurring friction point should become a feature. Stored in SQLite with a human ID such as `FTR-YYYYMMDD-001`.

```bash
python3 scripts/learnings.py --root /absolute/path/to/workspace log-feature \
  --summary "User needs report export to CSV" \
  --details "Needed for sharing weekly reports with non-technical stakeholders" \
  --pattern reports:csv-export
```

#### Backward-compatible log
The old `log` subcommand is preserved for compatibility:

```bash
python3 scripts/learnings.py --root /absolute/path/to/workspace log "Used wrong format" \
  --type COR --pattern chat:telegram-format --correct "Use lists" --force
```

To inspect or share entries, export from SQLite:

```bash
python3 scripts/learnings.py --root /absolute/path/to/workspace export
python3 scripts/learnings.py --root /absolute/path/to/workspace export --format json
```

### 6) Promote proven lessons into memory

Promote when the learning is broad, repeated, or something any future contributor should know.

Common targets:
- `CLAUDE.md` — durable project facts and conventions
- `AGENTS.md` — workflow rules and automation guidance
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — shared Copilot context
- `SOUL.md` — behavioural principles in Ghost workspaces
- `TOOLS.md` — tool-specific gotchas in Ghost workspaces

Write promotions as **short prevention rules**, not long incident write-ups.

Example:
- Bad promotion: "On 2026-03-12 npm failed because…"
- Good promotion: "Use `pnpm install` in this repo; it is a pnpm workspace."

When a learning is promoted, update the original entry's status to `promoted` or `promoted_to_skill` and record the destination.

`maintain` writes high-recurrence candidates to `learning/promotion-queue.json`. For fully automated deployments, `maintain --apply --auto-promote` promotes those candidates into the active workspace root while keeping the shared learning store separate when `--learning-root` is used.

### 7) Extract a reusable skill when the pattern is real

Extract a new skill when the solution is:
- resolved and working
- broadly useful beyond one file or repo
- non-obvious enough that future agents would benefit
- recurring enough to justify its own instructions

Use the helper:

```bash
bash scripts/extract-skill.sh my-skill-name /absolute/path/to/workspace
```

## Logging rules that matter most

1. **Search first.** Duplicate entries are worse than missing tags.
2. **Prefer durable lessons.** Only log what should change future behaviour.
3. **Be specific.** Name the assumption, failure, or convention clearly.
4. **Include the fix or prevention rule.** An entry without next action is weak.
5. **Use stable pattern keys for recurring problems.** This lets recurrence compound.
6. **Promote aggressively once a rule is proven.** The point is fewer repeat mistakes.
7. **Do not interrupt the user with bookkeeping.** Log silently unless the user asked to see it or you need missing details.
8. **Never log secrets.** Tokens, passwords, API keys, and private data must be redacted or omitted.

## Memory lifecycle (integrated from ivangdavila/self-improving)

Entries carry metadata (`First-Seen`, `Last-Seen`, `Recurrence-Count`, `Status`, `Area`) so the system can make deterministic lifecycle decisions without guessing.

| Tier | Location | Size guidance | Behavior |
|------|----------|---------------|----------|
| HOT | SQLite lifecycle `admitted` | Active working set | Shown by `status`, `search`, and hooks |
| WARM | SQLite lifecycle `buffered` | 30+ days unused | Retained for context-specific search |
| COLD | SQLite lifecycle `sealed` | archived/promoted/resolved | Retained for explicit query/export |

### Automatic promotion/demotion

Use `python3 scripts/learnings.py --root <workspace> maintain` to review:

| Condition | Threshold | Action |
|---|---|---|
| HOT -> WARM | 30 days unused | Set lifecycle to `buffered` |
| WARM -> COLD | 90 days unused | Set lifecycle to `sealed` |
| Frequent reuse | `Recurrence-Count >= 3` from explicit reuse (`search --touch` or `edit`) | Flag for project-memory promotion |
| Compaction/export | Human review needed | Export and manually summarize/promote without deleting the SQLite record |

`maintain` defaults to `--dry-run`. Use `--apply` to execute lifecycle status moves. It never deletes content and does not auto-summarize.

### Conflict resolution

When patterns contradict:
1. **More specific wins**: `project` > `domain` > `global`
2. **More recent wins** at the same specificity level
3. **Ambiguous conflicts** → ask the user instead of guessing

## Promotion thresholds (from legacy)

| Condition | Threshold | Action |
|---|---|---|
| HOT -> WARM | 30 days unused | Mark `buffered` |
| WARM -> COLD | 90 days unused | Mark `sealed` |
| Frequent reuse | 3 recorded uses within 7 days | Promote as a short prevention rule |
| To AGENTS/SOUL/TOOLS | `Recurrence-Count >= 3` + spans 2+ tasks + within 30 days | Promote as short prevention rule |
| To skill | Proven + broadly applicable | Extract as skill |

## Recommended references

Use these only when needed:
- `references/entry-formats.md` — full field schemas and manual templates
- `references/promotion-and-extraction.md` — promotion rules and skill extraction criteria
- `references/platform-setup.md` — Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, and Ghost setup notes

## Hooks

Hook helpers are intentionally optional and workspace-root aware.

Available hook scripts:
- `hooks/activator.sh` — lightweight reminder at prompt start
- `hooks/error-detector.sh` — lightweight error reminder after failed Bash-like commands

Hook configuration examples live in `references/platform-setup.md`.

## What "next-level" looks like for this skill

A mature use of this skill has a loop:

**capture → dedupe → promote → extract → evaluate**

That means:
- entries are created with stable human IDs, content-addressed chunk IDs, and consistent fields
- repeated issues link to each other instead of fragmenting
- proven rules move into persistent memory files
- broadly useful fixes become standalone skills
- the skill itself is tested with trigger and output evals in `evals/`
