# Companion integrations

Gardener works directly from verified task evidence. Companions are optional sources of learning records and review assistance, not runtime dependencies or implicit installation requests.

## Self-Improving Agent

Canonical source: [pskoett/self-improving-agent](https://github.com/pskoett/self-improving-agent). The installable package is its `self-improving-agent/` subdirectory, not the repository root. Current package name: `self-improving-agent`; older versions used `self-improvement`, which is also the hook name. Resolve the installed package through the catalog rather than assuming either path.

When using its records:

1. Read only the relevant entry in the selected workspace's `.learnings/LEARNINGS.md` or `.learnings/ERRORS.md` (or a completed feature request with actual execution evidence).
2. Check its source ID, `Pattern-Key`, `Skill-Path`, and available verification. A recurrence count or automatically detected error is a candidate, not proof of a successful procedure.
3. If already linked, inspect that skill before creating anything. Preserve the existing log schema and unrelated entries.
4. Only after application, validation, and discovery succeed, set:

   ```markdown
   **Status**: promoted_to_skill
   **Skill-Path**: skills/example-skill
   ```

   The example path denotes the skill directory; substitute the real location relative to the workspace where possible. `resolved` means the issue was fixed; `promoted` means promotion to workspace governance/memory. Neither substitutes for `promoted_to_skill`.
5. Add a short resolution note with the verification performed. Do not increase recurrence counts merely for rereading a record.

Gardener does not invoke the companion's extraction helper, install/enable its hook, or import its instructions to edit governance files. Those are separate operations. If the companion is independently enabled, Gardener cannot constrain its behavior in other turns; configure that separately through an authorized task.

### Reviewed version and limitations

Reviewed 2026-09-06: GitHub commit [`b889ef0`](https://github.com/pskoett/self-improving-agent/tree/b889ef0724c27b7181111b8dd1ac3a108d0b5160), package version 4.0.2. All 17 tracked repository files were inspected, including the JS/TS hook implementations, tests, extraction script, templates, references, and CI. The 13 hook tests passed; shell syntax checking passed. This identifies the reviewed GitHub source, not a guarantee that a registry package or later revision is identical.

Focused temporary-fixture checks confirmed:

- The optional session sweep scans user/assistant text as well as tool output, so ordinary error examples can become false positives.
- Best-effort redaction can retain a password in quoted JSON syntax. Treat log contents as potentially sensitive even when the hook claims to redact them.
- The extraction script rejects absolute paths and `..`, but a symlinked output directory can still write outside the workspace.

The hook reads full transcript/log files, and its write paths do not enforce symlink containment. Its uninstall reference also suggests removing `.learnings/` to disable sweeping; preserve learning data and use the supported hook-disable mechanism if disabling is requested. Gardener avoids all of these hook/extractor paths and consumes only selected, sanitized, verified records.

## External skill review and Skill Vetter

Review external candidates before enabling or executing them. Inspect the full package manifest and all instructions, executable files, hooks, dependency/install declarations, and referenced resources that can affect behavior. Do this as static reading first; do not run a package to discover what it does. Limit the review to that package and its actual dependencies.

Use the runtime's installed verification/review capability where available. [Skill Vetter by spclaudehome](https://ghost.ai/spclaudehome/skills/skill-vetter) is one optional review aid. If none is available, perform the review directly. Never install a vetter just to bootstrap the review of that same vetter.

Check actual file access, command execution, network destinations, credentials, and persistence against the requested capability. Reject hidden data transmission, instruction overrides, unexplained destructive behavior, or unreviewable code. Legitimate scoped access can be necessary; a keyword, popularity count, or automated scan result alone is not a verdict. Honor host/user restrictions even if a review tool recommends proceeding. Obtain any still-missing installation authorization after the specific package and its requirements are reviewable.

### Reviewed version and limitations

Reviewed 2026-09-06: the complete published Skill Vetter v1.0.0 instructions on the linked the skill registry page. They provide a static review checklist and example GitHub lookup commands. Their blanket rejection list includes accessing memory files and any base64 decoding, which can also occur in legitimate workflows, and their trust hierarchy relies partly on popularity. Use contextual evidence rather than treating those heuristics as proof of safety or malice.

The version archive/file manifest could not be retrieved in this review (the API returned HTTP 409). This is an instructions-only review, not a full package certification. The old README's claimed GitHub publisher mapping was not independently verified and is not used as an identity check. Before any installation, verify the actual owner, version, and complete package contents through the available registry tooling.

## Python audit parser

The audit has no runtime dependency. When an already-trusted environment supplies PyYAML, it subclasses `SafeLoader` and never uses the unsafe/default loader. Otherwise it uses its bounded stdlib parser for the documented frontmatter subset. Both paths reject duplicate mapping keys, aliases/merge keys, unsafe YAML tags, and excessive nesting. Input is capped at 1 MiB per file. No dependency is downloaded by the audit itself.
